<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <strong>Arnav Ganguly</strong>. I’m a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a> in Raleigh, NC.</p>

I operate at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I love building tools that automate complex tasks—whether that's a real-time web app for fine-tuning AI models or a crypto arbitrage bot running on Node.js.

### 💻 What I Do

I specialize in **Python**, **Java**, and **Node.js**. My recent focus has been on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to build practical applications.

* **AI & Voice Agents:** Integrating Vapi and OpenAI to create responsive, human-like voice interfaces.
* **FinTech:** Developing automated trading algorithms and analyzing financial market data.
* **Full Stack:** Building intuitive web interfaces to make complex backend logic accessible.

### 🚀 Beyond the Screen

When I'm not debugging code or optimizing algorithms, I step away from the keyboard to recharge:

* **Sports Enthusiast:** I am a die-hard fan of **FC Barcelona**, the **Seattle Seahawks**, and the **Wizards**.
* **Fitness:** I enjoy weightlifting and staying active at the gym.
* **Foodie:** I love exploring Raleigh's food scene (especially Italian and pizza) and experimenting with cooking new recipes.
* **Gaming:** You can catch me on **r9thegreat** playing EA FC or strategy games.
